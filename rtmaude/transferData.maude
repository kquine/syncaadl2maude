*** Transfer data
--- -------------

***(  ******************

A function transferData is called when data should be transfered
from the ultimate source output to the ultimate destination input.
   We first use a function initializeTransfer which for each thread
output data port, if the content is noMsg, it leaves it as it is,
but if it is data[I] or data[B] there, it adds a 'transfer' mark:
transfer[data[34]]. Likewise each thread input port is initilaized
to the fresh flag set to false; the content is not touched. 
   We then use the usual equations to move the transfer messages
up, down or sideways, until their destinations are reached.

Remark 1: This function is specially defined for our setting,
with env plus deterministic threads, and therefore treats delayed and
immediate connections the same!

Remark 2: In the single rewrite rule, there are some functions that
should be applied sequentially; e.g., applyTransitions should only
apply when all data have been ransfered to their ultimate destinations.
To achieve that sequentiality, we could, as in our Ptolemy approach,
use sort and supersorts, and careful use of variables to ensure the
desired effect. However, I think that in our current case, using
operator evaluation strategies might be slightly more elegant,
so we do not do the sorting approach here.

Remark 3: Jose would like to optimize the moving of messages a little bit
by having a memo-ized table that for each port gives its destinations,
and the path there, using also arrows 'up' 'down' and sideways', to make
this movement of messages more efficient, and then add to each message its
path, and then do the moving. We might do this optimization soon. 
But let's first get the thing working.

 --- the flag that makes the equations move the data.

 --- Initialize:

 eq initializeTransfer(REST) = REST [owise] .
 --- covers both the empty configuration and non-thread ports and

 --- Now, the equations to move messages:

 *** Connections of the form inport --> subcomponent . inport.
 --- I am not sure, but assume that we can 1-to-many connections
 --- of these as well. Notice that one-to-many connections,
 --- at least in the active standby example, are just declared
 --- as multiple single connections P --> P1 ; P --> P2, etc.  
  
 *** Assumptions:
 --- 1. There is no connection from inport p to outport p1 in the same
 ---    component. Does not seem to make much sense for data ports!
 --- 2. The content is only transfered if there is at least one connection
 ---    going out from the source!

 *** Notice: OWISE equation!
 eq transfer MC from PN to OBJECTS using CONXS = OBJECTS [owise] . 


 *** Finally, a message has arrived at its destination:

                     PORTS > .
 --- Notice that this one can VERY easily be modified if an input
